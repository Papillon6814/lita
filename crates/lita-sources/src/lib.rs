//! Where a Voice's material comes from when the person does not want to
//! paste (D-43): their own published writing. Each source turns into plain
//! `Piece`s that the intake screen offers as candidates; nothing here talks
//! to Codex or to Lita's store.
//!
//! All three sources need no login and no API key. note has a public JSON
//! API, Medium publishes RSS with full bodies (latest ten only), and X
//! reads are paid so the official data archive is the route.
